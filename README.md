## It's great to meet you! 👋

I'm Luke — here's a little bit about me:

🧠 Data engineer with a love for solving messy problems and optimizing workflows
🐍 Python, SQL, Docker, Airflow, Postgres
💻 Big fan of Home Assistant, 3D printing, and just about anything with a PCB
🛠️ Fixes things for fun (and because no one else wanted to)
🎯 Always experimenting, frequently documenting, perpetually iterating
🏦 Currently working in fintech (surprisingly fun), and always leveling up
